Phase 0: Setup & Mindset (The Base Camp)
Environment Setup:
Version Control: Initialize a Git repository immediately. git init. Commit often. Use platforms like GitHub or GitLab to host it. This is non-negotiable.
Programming Language: Python is your core for the backend/ML. Make sure you have a recent version (e.g., 3.9+).
Package Management: Use a virtual environment. python -m venv venv (or use conda). Activate it. This keeps your project dependencies isolated.
Code Editor/IDE: Use something you're comfortable with that has good Python support (VS Code with Python extensions is excellent, PyCharm is also great).
Choose Your Initial Tools (Keep it Simple):
Backend Framework: FastAPI. It's modern, fast (performance-wise and development-wise), has automatic docs, and uses Pydantic for data validation, which is fantastic. Flask is simpler if FastAPI feels like too much initially, but FastAPI pays off.
Core ML/Data Libraries: Install the essentials: pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas scikit-learn fairlearn shap matplotlib seaborn. (We'll use Matplotlib/Seaborn for basic plots initially before moving to interactive frontend charts).
Frontend Framework: Pick one: React, Vue, or Svelte. If you don't know one well, React has the largest community and job market, but Vue is often considered easier to learn initially. Don't overthink it; pick one and start learning. Use create-react-app, create-vue, or the Svelte template to get started quickly.
Find a Starting Dataset: Don't use your own complex data yet. Start with a well-known dataset often used for bias analysis.
Recommendation: The "Adult" Census Income dataset. It's readily available (e.g., via UCI ML Repository, or often included in fairness libraries/examples), relatively small, and has clear sensitive attributes (like 'race', 'sex') and a binary classification target ('income' >50K or <=50K). This lets you focus on the tool mechanics, not data wrangling.

Phase 1: The Core Backend Logic (The First Ascent)
Goal: Build the engine that can analyze a dataset and a simple model.
Data Loading & Basic Analysis API:
Create a FastAPI endpoint (e.g., /upload) that accepts a CSV file upload.
Use Pandas (pd.read_csv) to load it into a DataFrame.
Create another endpoint (e.g., /analyze-data) that takes the DataFrame (or a reference to the uploaded file) and:
Lets the user specify the target column and sensitive attribute columns (pass these as parameters in the API request).
Calculates basic descriptive statistics (e.g., value counts) for the sensitive attributes and the target variable, perhaps grouped by sensitive attribute. Return this info as JSON.
Baseline Model Training & Evaluation API:
Create an endpoint (e.g., /train-baseline) that:
Takes the DataFrame and user specifications (target, sensitive attributes, features to use).
Performs minimal preprocessing (e.g., one-hot encode categoricals, maybe scale numerics).
Trains a simple Scikit-learn model (e.g., LogisticRegression or RandomForestClassifier). Keep it simple!
Evaluates the model using standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1) overall.
Crucially: Evaluate the same metrics disaggregated by the sensitive attribute groups (e.g., Accuracy for group A vs. Accuracy for group B). Return all these metrics as JSON.
Fairness Metrics API:
Create an endpoint (e.g., /calculate-fairness) that takes the trained model, the (preprocessed) test data, and the sensitive attributes.
Use the Fairlearn library (MetricFrame) to easily calculate fairness metrics. Start with one or two key ones:
DemographicParityDifference (Statistical Parity Difference)
EqualizedOddsDifference
Return these fairness metric values as JSON.
Basic Explainability API:
Create an endpoint (e.g., /explain-model) that takes the trained model and some data.
Use SHAP (e.g., shap.KernelExplainer for model-agnostic, or shap.TreeExplainer if using tree models).
Calculate SHAP values. For now, maybe just calculate global feature importance (mean absolute SHAP value per feature). Return this as JSON. (Visualizations come later).

Phase 2: The Basic Frontend Interface (Seeing the View)
Goal: Create a simple UI to interact with the backend APIs.
Basic UI Structure:
Set up your chosen frontend framework (React/Vue/Svelte).
Create components for:
File Upload.
Displaying basic data analysis results (tables are fine for now).
Displaying model performance metrics (overall and per group).
Displaying fairness metrics.
Displaying basic SHAP feature importances.
Connect Frontend to Backend:
Use fetch or libraries like axios to make API calls from your frontend JavaScript code to your FastAPI backend endpoints.
Wire up the UI:
The file upload component calls the /upload endpoint.
Buttons trigger calls to /analyze-data, /train-baseline, /calculate-fairness, /explain-model.
Display the JSON responses from the backend in your UI components.

Phase 3: The First Mitigation Loop (Mapping the Route)
Goal: Implement ONE mitigation strategy and show its effect.
Implement Backend Mitigation Logic:
Choose one simple pre-processing technique. Reweighing is a good start (Fairlearn might have utilities, or you can implement the logic manually using Pandas based on group proportions).
Create a new endpoint (e.g., /apply-reweighing-and-retrain) that:
Takes the original data and specifications.
Applies the reweighing logic to generate sample weights.
Retrains the same simple Scikit-learn model, but this time passing the sample_weight parameter during the .fit() call.
Recalculates the performance and fairness metrics for this mitigated model.
Returns the new metrics.
Add Mitigation to Frontend:
Add a button/control in the UI labeled "Try Reweighing Mitigation".
When clicked, call the new /apply-reweighing-and-retrain endpoint.
Display the metrics from the mitigated model side-by-side with the baseline metrics. This comparison is KEY!


At this point, you would have a very basic, maybe ugly, but functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It demonstrates the core loop: Load Data -> Analyze -> Train Baseline -> See Bias -> Apply Mitigation -> See Result.

Key Advice While Starting:
Keep it Simple: Resist the urge to add complexity early. Simple model, simple dataset, one mitigation technique, basic UI.
Test Incrementally: Test each API endpoint as you build it (FastAPI's automatic /docs page is invaluable here). Test the frontend components connect properly.
Understand the Libraries: Don't just copy-paste code. Read the docs for Fairlearn, SHAP, Scikit-learn. Understand what the functions do and what the metrics mean.
Don't Get Stuck: If you hit a wall, simplify the problem, search for specific errors, ask questions (Stack Overflow, specific library forums/discords), or take a break.
Enjoy the Process: This is a learning journey. You'll touch backend, frontend, ML, data ethics. It's challenging but rewarding.
